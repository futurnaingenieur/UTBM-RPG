Hi! I'm futurnaingenieur, one of the 7 developers of this RPG game. This Readme is here in order to provide 
informations about the conception of this huge project. It'll be filled all along our work with news and so long...

UTBM-RPG is an RPG develloped in C++ and SFML by 7 passionated students from the UTBM (University of Technology Belfort-Montbeliard) beside their studies. In this game, you'll incarnate a new student coming in the UTBM. To survive, you will have to fight against the meanest teachers and make friends inside this big new environment. 
We divided the work in several teams:
-1st team: Develloping (2 C++ Developers);
-2nd team: Scenario and Game Design (2 scenario Writters);
-3rd team: Graphics and Level Design (2 Graphist working on photoshop)
-4th team: Music and Sounds (1 Musician)
